# Dog Park Finder

## Description

This is a simple application a dog lover might use to assist them in locating dog parks. Upon entering the city/town of their choice, the user will be presented with a map of that location, featuring markers with infowindows showing the name, address, and rating of each dog park. They will also see that information in list form along the left side of the screen.

This application/project demonstrates knowledge of server-side APIs(Google Maps, Google Places, Open Weather), GitHub, Agile, HTML, CSS, Bulma, JavaScript, JQuery, Git, and Canva.
